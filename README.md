# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I was given the task to create a thermostat using the cc3220sf utilizing the GPIO, I2C, and UART. TMP006 temperature sensor to read the room temperature (via I2C), an LED to indicate the output to the thermostat where LED on = heat on (via GPIO), two buttons to increase and decrease the set temperature (via GPIO interrupt), and the UART to simulate the data being sent to the server.TMP006 temperature sensor to read the room temperature (via I2C), an LED to indicate the output to the thermostat where LED on = heat on (via GPIO), two buttonsto increase and decrease the set temperature (via GPIO interrupt), and the UART to simulate the data being sent to the server.

# What did you do particularly well?
I created code for all components of the project. Some code was given to me and I had to intergrate it. Created code that initializes the timer and uses it to drive specified actions. Created code that uses interrupt to detect button presses. Created code to initialize the I2C peripheral and use it to read the temperature sensor. Created code to initialize the GPIO peripheral and use it. Created code to initialize the UART peripheral and output specified data. Implement a task scheduler functionality.

# Where could you improve?
I can improve in the coding of the C language. This was the first time using C. I will be practicing my coding skills along with best practices.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
One of the best tools I am adding is the 10 best practices that I learned in this course. I have studyed best practices in coding before this, but I added new onces in this course. A few resources I will be adding are the interview questions. I have started to build a "study pack" of common and uncommon interview questions. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
As I stated before, I have never used the C language or worked with embedded systems. Both of these skills will be useful in the future. Also I did more debugging in this final project than all others combined. Debugging is a crutial skill in programming. 

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used clear and descriptive variable names, comments, proper indentation and formatting, wrote modular code, and avoided hard-coding values.
